- **PRIVACERA** [ <https://privacera.com/> ]
  - PrivaceraCloud is a fully managed service which provides data access control across cloud services through a single unified interface.
  - Privacera works with over 50 file types, including structured types (Apache Avro, Apache Parquet, CSV), semi-structured types (JSON, XML), and unstructured types (documents, PDF).
  - Automates compliance workflows and reporting for RTBF, HIPAA, GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, and other regulations. Ensures consistency and reduces effort to manage privacy across cloud services.
  - Automatically identify, tag and classify sensitive data with scalable data discovery across hybrid- and multi-clouds. Monitor, mask and encrypt data to secure access.
  
- **Cyral** [<https://cyral.com/> ]
  - Cyral helps to see, control, and protect every piece of the data in databases and data lakes without impacting performance and agility.
  - Databases, data warehouses and data lakes are typically accessed using shared accounts or service accounts resulting in insecure database access. This makes it difficult to track who had access to what data and what they did with it because user identities are often hidden.
  - Cyral transparently captures user identity and brings identity-centric controls to the center of the security and governance operations.

- **Transcend** [ <https://transcend.io/security/> ]
  - Transcend integrates with the systems through a secure gateway. Transcend never sees any organization's secrets or data because the gateway integrates with the existing key management systems.
  - Data is encrypted with AES-256 before it leaves your firewall, and only decrypted in your data subject’s browser.
  - To operate on data, the system requires cryptographic proof that an authenticated data subject gave consent to the operation.
  - It is not possible for Transcend to delete an arbitrary user's data.

- **Privacy Dynamics** [ <https://www.privacydynamics.io/> ]
  - Privacy Dynamics delivers accurate, reliable, privacy-safe data within minutes.
  - It provides production ready, anonymized data in minutes as classification, policy management or data mapping is not required.
  - Records are analysed and labelled after direct identifiers have been removed or masking. Unidentifiable records are left alone, while identifiable records are treated. As a result, the data is highly accurate while remaining private.
  - It is very fast, anonymizes millions of records per minute and writes privacy safe data schemas directly in Snowflake

- **InCountry** [ <https://incountry.com/> ]
  - They use industry-standard encryption standards to enable the security and privacy of the data in every phase of their operations.
  - Their preventative controls and measures guard the data from security breaches with threat detection and continuous monitoring and response.
  - We protect your data with industry standard encryption methods including AES-256 for data at rest and TLS1.3 for data in transit.
  - Their policies enable the customers to comply with related privacy and data protection laws.

- **skyflow** [ <https://www.skyflow.com/> ]
  - Skyflow is an enterprise-grade data security and privacy platform.
  - Skyflow is designed to give developers the out-of-the-box functionality they need to quickly get started and the flexibility to endlessly customize.
  - They have end to end encryption and tokenization in thier data privacy vault.
  - They achieve full compliance from PCI, GDPR, CCPA.
  - They follow established security patterns for hardening, encryption, authentication and authorization.

- **Duality** [ <https://dualitytech.com/> ]
  - Duality operationalizes Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) – empowering organizations to share and analyze encrypted data.
  - Duality's SecurePlus® enables multiple parties to securely compute on sensitive data while preserving privacy, confidentiality, and regulatory compliance.
  - Duality's SecurePlus can securely share insights by performing privacy-preserving queries on decentralized data sets.
  - It can also be used to create and manage our own privacy-protected network.

- **Ketch** [ <https://www.ketch.com/> ]
  - Ketch offers modern technology solutions to fast–track any privacy program.
  - It protects data with accurate record keeping of consent and consumer privacy choices, discovery and classification of sensitive and personal data data, fulfillment of data subject requests
  - Ketch automates data privacy, governance, and security through a coordinated set of applications, infrastructure, and enabling APIs

- **Cape Privacy** [ <https://capeprivacy.com/> ]
  - Cape Privacy enables businesses to run predictive machine learning models on encrypted data.
  - Cape’s platform uses secure multiparty computation (MPC) to operationalize the data securely, avoiding a single point of failure and enabling computations on data that was previously inaccessible.
  - Instead, encrypted data can now be transferred to a third-party data cloud, along with any models clients want, and predictions can be made using the encrypted data. Privacy and security compliance are ensured because the data is never decrypted.
