### **Real Time Data Integration and Analytics**
Real-time analytics is the discipline that applies logic and mathematics to data to provide insights for making better decisions quickly. For some use cases, real time simply means the analytics is completed within a few seconds or minutes after the arrival of new data. On-demand real-time analytics waits for users or systems to request a query and then delivers the analytic results. Continuous real-time analytics is more proactive and alerts users or triggers responses as events happen.

**Why Real Time data integration matters**

- **Economical and Effecient Transfer of Data** - Real-time data integration moves single record and not an entire batch it is more efficient and can save money in cloud environments. 
- **Better insight and visibility into your business** – With real time dashboards that monitor key areas such as customer purchases, inventory levels, operations, the supply chain, et cetera management and staff are provided with a constant flow of insight to make better decisions with and improve performance.
- **Superior Customer Service** – Customer service can be taken to new levels with customer service representatives being able to provide real time information on available stock, a customer’s purchase history, account balances and loyalty rewards.
- **Better Customer Engagement** – For example, with systems integrated in real time an order management system can inform the CRM system that a purchase has been made triggering it to immediately send a thank you email to the customer.
- **Efficient & Economical Transfer of Data** – Real time integration works by moving an individual record between systems rather than a batch of records. As such it is more efficient which can turn into significant cost savings in cloud environments where software vendors typically increase charges when more data is pulled from their systems.

**Challanges**
- A major challenge in real-time data integration is the failure of a component in a few sections of the pipeline. Improper designing may lead to a stale unorganized data system outage or data loss. Establishing resiliency in each phase and decoupling of every phase in the pipeline makes the system run smoothly.
